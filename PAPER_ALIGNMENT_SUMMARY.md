# PairTally Benchmark - Paper Alignment Summary

## ✅ Repository Successfully Aligned with Paper

Your repository has been successfully organized and updated to accurately reflect your DICTA 2025 paper "Can Current AI Models Count What We Mean, Not What They See? A Benchmark and Systematic Evaluation".

## 📊 Key Corrections Made

### 1. **Dataset Name Corrected**
- ❌ Previously: "DICTA25 Dataset"  
- ✅ Now: **"PairTally Dataset"** (matches your paper)

### 2. **Accurate Dataset Statistics**
- **681 high-resolution images** (not XXX placeholder)
- **54 object categories** with **98 subcategories**
- **97 subcategory pairs**: 47 INTRA-category + 50 INTER-category
- **Fine-grained attributes**: Color (43.5%), Texture/Shape (42.5%), Size (14.1%)

### 3. **Correct Model Count & Organization**
- ✅ **10 models total** (not 9 as previously stated)
- **4 Exemplar-based**: FamNet, DAVE, GeCo, LOCA
- **2 Language-prompted**: CountGD, LLMDet  
- **4 Vision-Language Models**: Ovis2, Qwen2.5-VL, LLaMA-3.2, InternVL3

### 4. **Accurate Performance Results**
Updated with actual results from your paper (Table 2):

| Model | MAE | RMSE | Performance Rank |
|-------|-----|------|------------------|
| **GeCo** | **53.07** | **98.00** | 🥇 Best |
| **CountGD** | **57.33** | **108.93** | 🥈 2nd |
| **LOCA** | 62.78 | 136.76 | 🥉 3rd |
| **DAVE** | 69.49 | 130.42 | 4th |
| **FamNet** | 88.30 | 148.42 | 5th |
| VLMs | 97.56-115.98 | 174.16-179.89 | Poor |

### 5. **Proper Super-Categories**
- ✅ **Food, Fun, Household, Office, Other** (not FOO, FUN, HOU, OFF, OTR)
- ✅ Detailed examples matching Table 1 from your paper

### 6. **Key Research Findings Highlighted**
- **VLM Limitations**: All VLMs perform poorly (MAE > 97)
- **INTER vs INTRA**: Models struggle more with fine-grained INTRA-category distinctions
- **Attribute Sensitivity**: Color easiest, size/texture more challenging
- **Failure Modes**: Models often overcount and ignore prompts

## 🎯 Paper-Specific Highlights

### Core Research Questions (from your paper)
1. ✅ **Can models count all objects accurately?** → No, even best models have high MAE
2. ✅ **Can models distinguish two distinct categories?** → Struggles with INTER-category
3. ✅ **Can models count visually similar variants?** → Poor INTRA-category performance  
4. ✅ **Which attributes are most challenging?** → Color easiest, size/texture harder

### Evaluation Protocol Accuracy
- ✅ **Exemplar-based models**: 3 bounding boxes per scene
- ✅ **CountGD**: Two modes (exemplar+text, text-only)
- ✅ **LLMDet**: Text-only mode
- ✅ **VLMs**: Unified prompt format with `<count>N</count>` tags

### Metrics & Analysis
- ✅ **Primary metrics**: MAE, RMSE, NAE (Normalized Absolute Error)
- ✅ **Consistency Index (CI)**: For measuring bias between object types
- ✅ **Attribute-specific analysis**: Color, Size, Texture/Shape breakdown
